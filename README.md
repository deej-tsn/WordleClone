# WordleClone

A wordle clone built using Vite+React to practice sending data to and from react components.

Works by dividing the application into the grid and the keyboard.
The grid is then divided into row components.
These row components are made up of square components.

Similarly for the keyboard, it is made up of keyboard row components which are made up of keyboard key components.

It is a simple application but reverse engineering the game was fun and i learnt more about the best way to pass data between components!
